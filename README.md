# Numerus

C++ class used to perform mathematics on quite big numbers,
may be very slow on some computers.

## How to test it?
Open a terminal. Then type :
./build.sh

Pray the C++ god and request from him it goes through the compiling. Then type :
./numerus-test

(The building file is for linux only for the moment, we will probably move to a makefile)
